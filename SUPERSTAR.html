        <p style="color:red">Shivaji Rao Gaekwad (born 12 December 1950), known professionally as Rajinikanth, is an Indian actor who works primarily in Tamil cinema. He began acting in plays while working in the Bangalore Transport Service as a bus conductor. In 1973, he
            joined the Madras Film Institute to pursue a diploma in acting. Following his debut in K. Balachander's 1975 Tamil drama Apoorva Raagangal, his acting career commenced with a brief phase of portraying antagonistic characters in Tamil films.
            After earning ₹26 crore (equivalent to ₹59 crore or US$8.2 million in 2018) for his role in Sivaji (2007), Rajinikanth became the highest-paid actor in Asia after Jackie Chan at the time. As of 2019, Rajinikanth has won six Tamil Nadu State
            Film Awards—four Best Actor Awards and two Special Awards for Best Actor—and a Filmfare Best Tamil Actor Award. In addition to acting, he has also worked as a producer and screenwriter. The Government of India has honored him with the Padma
            Bhushan (2000) and the Padma Vibhushan (2016). At the 45th International Film Festival of India (2014), he was conferred with the "Centenary Award for Indian Film Personality of the Year". At the 50th edition, he will be honored with the Icon
            of Global Jubilee award.[3]</p>
